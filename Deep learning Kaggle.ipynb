Being so specific, they tend to be fragile: remove one and the conspiracy falls apart.\n",

To break up these conspiracies, we randomly drop out some fraction of a layer's input units every step of training, making it much harder for the network to learn those spurious patterns in the training data. Instead, it has to search for broad, general patterns, whose weight patterns tend to be more robust.\n",

Individuals in the committee tend to make different kinds of mistakes, but be right at the same time, making the committee as a whole better than any individual.

The reason is that SGD will shift the network weights in proportion to how large an activation the data produces. Features that tend to produce activations of very different sizes can make for unstable training behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if it's good to normalize the data before it goes into the network, maybe also normalizing inside the network would be better! In fact, we have a special kind of layer that can do this, the batch normalization layer. A batch normalization layer looks at each batch as it comes in, first normalizing the batch with its own mean and standard deviation, and then also putting the data on a new scale with two trainable rescaling parameters. Batchnorm, in effect, performs a kind of coordinated rescaling of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, batchnorm is added as an aid to the optimization process (though it can sometimes also help prediction performance). Models with batchnorm tend to need fewer epochs to complete training. Moreover, batchnorm can also fix various problems that can cause the training to get \"stuck\". Consider adding batch normalization to your models, especially if you're having trouble during training."

    "Accuracy is one of the many metrics in use for measuring success on a classification problem. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions: accuracy = number_correct / total. A model that always predicted correctly would have an accuracy score of 1.0. All else being equal, accuracy is a reasonable metric to use whenever the classes in the dataset occur with about the same frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with accuracy (and most other classification metrics) is that it can't be used as a loss function. SGD needs a loss function that changes smoothly, but accuracy, being a ratio of counts, changes in \"jumps\". So, we have to choose a substitute to act as the loss function. This substitute is the cross-entropy function\n",
